    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this project we want to answer a few machine learning related questions. The questions are the following : \n",
    "* How do ML-algorithms perform when applied to datasets with different levels of dimensionality, and what are the best dimensionality reduction techniques for improving performance in the presence of data challenges?\n",
    "* How does the choice of regularization techniques (such as L1 or L2 regularization, dropout, or early stopping) impact the extent of overfitting in various types of machine learning models?\n",
    "* How does the choice of model complexity, such as the number of features, hidden layers, and neurons in a neural network, influence the risk of underfitting in machine learning models, and how can model complexity be optimized to balance the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we will try to fit data on 3 widely different models (for both classification and regression problems) in term of complexity, and the way each algorithm works. It is important to note that we choose to go with real-life existing datasets and also synthetic datasets."
